- 👋 Hi, I’m @myersc
- 👀 I’m interested in Type 1 Diabetes Tech - Nightscout, Loop, etc
- 🌱 I’m currently learning life lessons
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something I can support with little to no coding knowledge that benefits humanity, diabetics, rainbows, lollipops, and sunshine.
- 📫 I only get on github semianually, maybe quarterly ... so good luck.
